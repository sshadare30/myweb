            <p> Hi there!
                Thanks for coming to check out my portfolio. Here, I would post the school projects I have done.
                I mean, its not a lot actually but I would post the one I have got.
                I also decided to choose this so I could show recruiters and when I get really good at this, I would keep updating it.
                Thank you for your time!
                </p>
